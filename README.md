# Share
a simple jQuery plugin for social share buttons.

Because let's face it the default share buttons suck, they're ugly and slow.

Supports twitter, facebook, google plus and linkedin

Adding it to your site or app:

- Add `share-title` class to the heading or bit of text you want to share
- Add `share-sub` class for additional text
- Add `share-twitter, share-fb, share-gplus, share-linkedin` to the anchor elements.
